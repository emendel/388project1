1. Because the HMAC message authentication code hash doesn't have the construction H(key || message), messages hashed with the HMAC hash cannot be used in length extension attacks because the attacker cannot use length of the secret and the message known and transform it into a new message. 
 
2. Using a hash collision attack, digital signatures that verify the integrity of programs can be altered if they are generated through MD5 hashes of the program. An MD5 hash could generate a collision between two different types of digital signatures (a valid signature and invalid signature) and the malicious program applying a length extension and attaching a suffix which performs some operation to fool the operating system to validate the program and install a malicious virus on the computer. In order to generate a collision, a program could run the fastcoll program until a collision is generated.  
 
3. Bleichenbacher's Attacks sends sever million test ciphertexts to the decryption device to slowly revel the content of the RSA encrypted message. Since the NIST has specified that RSA public exponents should be at least 2^16 +  1, it isn't feasible to send millions of test ciphertexts because the attack would take too long to crack these keys.
